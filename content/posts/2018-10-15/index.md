##Overview:

<hr/>

An app/website/plug-in/add-on where you can give a shop/mall/any other point of interest a rating based on how well the visitors and the staff are following the social distancing norms enforced by the government. These are essential to prevent the spread of this virus, and also protect yourself from being impacted. Users can rate places from unacceptable to excellent. The users will be the data providers - they will rate the institution, and also the potential customers - checking what social distancing rating the place has. We can come up with simple gamification algorithms (badges, scores, levels) to award users for their efforts. According to studies, social distancing can stretch into late 2021 or even 2022 (~2 years from today). There is an urge to do this app.

Some of the staff at Walmart, Lowe's, and similar stores breach their own social distancing policies. They go against the signs they put up which recommend the distancing guidelines and precautions outlined by the government for the safety of visitors. It will be a community effort to protect the community itself. These ratings can also be for beaches, markets, parks, religious institutions, and other non-commercial locations where people gather.

It will help the users assess the risk of visiting a particular place. It will also help them understand the type of precautions they should take when going there. This will also encourage people to go to the risk-prone establishments at off-peak periods if they really donâ€™t have another option. In fact, a low rating will force shops and other institutions to strictly enforce their social distancing guidelines. This can help increase our safety and stop the rapid spread of the virus. Businesses would not want to have a low rating, since that could lead to a decline in customers and other consequences.
