  // About Secton --------------
  aboutParaOne:
  "My name is Ray Ngan. I have recently graduated from University of California, Davis with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.",
  aboutParaTwo:
  "Currently, I am working at Palo Alto Networks as a software engineer for the L7 Security Team. I enjoy solving various challenging problems from my job. Also I am committed to shape the future of cybersecurity and disrupt the way things are done traditionally.",
  aboutParaThree:
  "Other than work, one of my biggest hobbies is badminton. I started playing badminton when I was 7 and it has become part of my passion ever since. I am still actively competing in many different tournaments as I am still trying to improve and master the game.",
  aboutParaFour:
  "Other than badminton, one of my other favorite hobbies is photography. I love how much creative space you have when composing different images. The skyâ€™s the limit! Here are some pictures I took and created.",
    // "Other than technical skills, this research experience allows me to develop my interpersonal skills. Each week we would have our team meeting with fellow undergraduate, graduate researchers, and the professor. During these team meetings, we will go over what we have been working on, some challenges that we encountered, and what we should do going forward. In these meetings, we can voice our opinions and contribute to the discussion for the research. I found this to be a very valuable opportunity for me since it is very different from what the normal computer science classes would offer. Fostering a conversation and discussing a topic that I am passionate about is very exciting and intriguing for me. I truly believe that this research experience gives me an unique perception of software development.",

    "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",
