  // About Secton --------------
  aboutParaOne:
  "My name is Ray Ngan. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Davis. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I have been working on research about browser fingerprinting along with an NSF REU research scholarship. I am looking forward to using my programming and problem-solving skills learned from academia and applying them in real-world settings. I would also hope to further my knowledge as a software developer and contribute to some of the greatest technical challenges seen today.",
  aboutParaTwo:
  "Currently, I am working on a browser fingerprinting research supervised by the UC Davis CS faculty.  It is about investigating the robustness of the browser fingerprinting detectors, specifically on the impact of obfuscation on these browser fingerprinting detectors. I have learned a lot from my experience in research. Research has allowed me to grow as a software developer because of the structure and freedom that research has. It is different from my typical programming classes, which only consist of assignments, projects, and exams. In research, I can come up with my solutions and structures. I could also shift the details and topics I want to investigate in during the journey of research. Also every week, I would meet up with Professor Zubair Shafiq to discuss my insights and progress on the research.  Recently, I have presented my research findings on the adblocker dev summit of 2021.",
  aboutParaThree:
  "One of my biggest hobbies is badminton. I started playing badminton when I was 5 and it has become my favorite sport ever since. When I got older, I started training and began to compete in many different tournaments. I was once ranked number 10 nationally in the U.S. for men’s badminton.",
  aboutParaFour:
  "Other than badminton, one of my other favorite hobbies is photography. I love how much creative space you have in creating images. You can take pictures of any objects and things and you can modify them in any form using Photoshop. Anything you can imagine, you can create. The sky’s the limit! Here are some pictures I took and created.",
    // "Other than technical skills, this research experience allows me to develop my interpersonal skills. Each week we would have our team meeting with fellow undergraduate, graduate researchers, and the professor. During these team meetings, we will go over what we have been working on, some challenges that we encountered, and what we should do going forward. In these meetings, we can voice our opinions and contribute to the discussion for the research. I found this to be a very valuable opportunity for me since it is very different from what the normal computer science classes would offer. Fostering a conversation and discussing a topic that I am passionate about is very exciting and intriguing for me. I truly believe that this research experience gives me an unique perception of software development.",
