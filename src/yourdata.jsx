  // About Secton --------------
  aboutParaOne:
    "My name is Wai Hei Ngan (Ray). I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Davis. I am pursuing a Bachelor's of science degree in Computer Science. I have been workikng on a research about browser fingerprinting along with a NSF REU research scholarship. I am looking forward to use my programming and problem solving skills learned from academia and apply them in the real worlds settings. I would also hope to furter my knowledge as a software devloper and contribute to some of the greatest technical challenges seen today.",
  aboutParaTwo:
    "Currently, I am working on a browser fingerprinting research supervised by the UC Davis CS faculty.  It is about investigating robustness of the browser fingerprinting detectors, specifially on the impact of obfuscation on these browser fingerprinting detectors. I have learned a lot from my experince in research. Reserach has allowed me to grow as a software develper becuase of the strucutre and freedom that research has. It is different than my typically programming classes, which only consist of assingments, projects, and exams. In research, I can come up with my own solutions and structures. I could also shifts the details and topics I want to investigate in during the journey of research. Also every week, I would meet up with the professor to discuss about my insights and progress on the research.  Recently, I have presented my reserach findings on the adblocker dev summit of 2021.",
  aboutParaThree:
    "One of my biggest hobbies is badminton. I started playing badminton when I was 5 and it has become my favorite sport ever since. When I got my order, I started training and began to compete in many different tournaments. I was once ranked number 10 nationally in the U.S. for men’s badminton. ",
  aboutParaFour:
  "Other than badminton, my other favorite hobby is photography. I love how much creativity space you have in creating images. You can take pictures of any objects and things and you can modify them in any form using Photoshop. Anything you can imagine, you can create. The sky’s the limit! Here are some pictures I took and created.",
    // "Other than technical skills, this research experience allows me to develop my interpersonal skills. Each week we would have our team meeting with fellow undergraduate, graduate researchers, and the professor. During these team meetings, we will go over what we have been working on, some challenges that we encountered, and what we should do going forward. In these meetings, we can voice our opinions and contribute to the discussion for the research. I found this to be a very valuable opportunity for me since it is very different from what the normal computer science classes would offer. Fostering a conversation and discussing a topic that I am passionate about is very exciting and intriguing for me. I truly believe that this research experience gives me an unique perception of software development.",
